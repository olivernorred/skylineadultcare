		<p class="promoparagraph">Elizabeth Sickert (a resident in this home) says: “Growing into my senior years is a sure challenge to me. Now I am not able to care for myself as I would like. Living here allows me and affords me the dignity to be myself, in spite of my physical limitations. I can have the freedom to enjoy my room, go out with the family to church and even have guests visit me. I am safe, cared for and loved.”</p>

		<h2 class="tagline">About the owner: Adriana Luca</h2>
		<br>
		<p class="promoparagraph">
			I have been working in adult care for over seven years. I love working with the elderly, and I have known I would work in this field ever I took care of my grandmother. I understand how hard it is when your loved one goes through changes in their life and needs more care. When I graduated from University of Portland with my bachelor's degree in Organizational Communication/Marketing, I realized that I could apply much of what I learned to my adult care home. I am excited to be a part of your loved one’s life.
