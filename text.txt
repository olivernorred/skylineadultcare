Elizabeth Sickert (a resident in this home) says: “Growing into my senior years is a sure challenge to me.  Now I am not able to care for myself as I would like. Living here allows me and affords me the dignity to be myself, in spite of my physical limitations. I can have the freedom to enjoy my room, go out with the family to church and even have guests visit me. I am safe, cared for and loved.” Fred Sickert

About the Owner:
Adriana Luca

I have been working in adult care for over seven years. I love working with the elderly and I have always known I would work in this field ever since I took care of my grandmother. I understand how hard it is when your loved one goes through different changes  in their life and needs more care. When  I graduated from University of Portland with my Bachelors Degree in Organizational Communication/Marketing, I realized that so much of what I had  learned I could apply to my adult care home. I am very excited that I will be a part of your loved one’s life.
